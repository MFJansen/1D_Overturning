PyMOC: Python Meridional Overturning Circulation Model
======================================================

PyMOC is a simple, modular suite of python ocean column models for
use in studying the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC). The 
MOC plays a critical role in the uptake and redistribution of heat
and carbon by the ocean, and as such both mediates and is governed
by shifts in the climate regime. As such, understanding of the MOC
is crucial to understanding of climate change.
