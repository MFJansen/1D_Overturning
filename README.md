This repository includes simple scripts for both Matlab or Python
to solve a  1D equation for the equilibrium  upper overturning cell,
(documentation to follow)

As always with code, there may well be errors, and it's
not recommended to use and trust this as a "black box".
If you find any errors, please get in touch!

Thanks to Mike Bueti for contributing the Python version!

The current script is very simple, and only finds equilibrium solutions
for the upper cell, with prescribed upwelling in the Southern Ocean.
I'm hoping to keep extending this to include a time-dependent version 
and additional components. If you want to contribute, please get in touch!
