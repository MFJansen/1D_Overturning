This repository is part of a project to develop a modular suite of simple models for the the deep ocean stratification and MOC. The project is very much ongoing, and if you want to contribute, please get in touch!

As always with code, there are likely to be errors, and it's not recommended to use and trust this as a "black box". If you find any errors, please get in touch!

Notice that the matlab code is legacy and no longer being developed (although anybody is welcome to take on that task).
