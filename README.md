This repository is part of a project to develop a modular suite of  simple models
for the the deep ocean stratification and MOC. The project is very much ongoing,
and if you want to contribute, please get in touch!

As always with code, there are likely to be bugs, and it's not recommended to use
and trust this as a "black box". If you find any issues, please get in touch!

Notice that the matlab code is legacy and no longer being developed (although anybody
is welcome to take on that task).
