For now this repository only includes a simple Matlab script
to solve the  1D equation for the equilibrium  upper overturning cell,
as discussed in Jansen (????, submitted to JPO)

As always with code, there may well be errors, and it's
not recommended to use and trust this as a "black box"

If you find any errors, or want to make improvements, please get in touch!

I'm also hoping to write (or even better: have somebody write ;)
a Python version of this. If you are interested in that, please
also get in touch!
